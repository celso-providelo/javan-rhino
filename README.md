# (Provisional) Deployment process

Build the confined *snap*:

    $ snapcraft

It embeds a MongoDB server which will launch upon installation:

    $ snap install javan-rhino_1_amd64.snap --force-dangerous
    ...
    javan-rhino 1 installed

However still not launching the service automatically, it has to be done manually:

    $ javan-rhino.devel
    ...

Similarly, a *production* service can be launchpad manually:

    $ javan-rhino.production
    ...
